## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Using the newer way of uncontrolled components. It was quite hard as I am used to controlled components. I actually had to somewhat mix them

### Continued development

Would be great as the basis of a form in a larger project
